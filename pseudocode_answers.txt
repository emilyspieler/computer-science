Short Answer
Why do programmers use pseudocode?

// programmers use pseudocode in order to assist in developing algorithms.
//its a form of brainstorming.

If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
//it's meant for humans to read, not computer so the code would not work.

Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
  IF first number > than second number THEN
    PRINT first number
  ELSE
    PRINT second number
  END IF

Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

WHILE number is < 0 && > 100
  INCREMENT number
  PRINT number
END WHILE

Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INPUT entry
  IF name === entry THEN
    PRINT contact info
  END IF
END

Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

const addressBook = [
  {name: 'karen brown', number: '222-222-3333'},
  {name: 'steve smith', number: '111-222-3333'}
];

const contactName = 'karen brown';

const contactInformation = addressBook.find( person => person.name === contactName );

console.log(contactInformation);
