Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

Making coffee;

(I don't drink coffee so I actually had to google how to make coffee since I've never made it! haha! Hopefully this is an accurate depiction of the process :) )

Function fillPot(water)
Turn On Water
SET water TO on
  While water is ON
    Pour water into coffee.pot
  END while

Function fillCoffeeMaker(coffee.beans)
  GET coffee.beans
  GET coffee.filter
    WHILE coffee.filter Empty
      SET coffee.beans in filter
    END While
END FUNCTION

function addIngredientsToPot(coffee.pot)
  GET coffee.filter
    IF coffee.filter is FULL
      Place coffee.filter in coffee.machine
    END IF
  GET coffee.pot
    if coffee.pot is FULL
      Pour water in coffee.pot
      Place empty coffee.pot on heater
  END IF
END Function

function makeCoffee(coffee)
  if coffee.filter is FULL && coffee.pot is FULL
    Turn on coffee.machine
    Return coffee
  END IF


Washing dishes;

Function washDishes(dish)
  Turn On dish.water
  Pick up disk dish.soap
  SET dish.water TO on
    While dish.water is ON
      Pick up dish
      place dish.soap on dish
      spread dish.soap on dish
      remove dish.soap with dish.water
    END while
  Turn off dish.Water
END FUNCTION


A choice of your own.

Getting on the train at my train stop to go downtown:

Function enterTrainStation(CTA)
  ENTER CTA.station
  GET CTA.pass FROM user.wallet
    WHILE CTA.pass === Ready
      SHOW CTA.gate user CTA.pass
      Return "verified- please enter"
      Enter CTA.gate
    END While
END FUNCTION

function enterTrain(brownLine)
  ENTER CTA.brownLine
  if CTA.brownLine === Kimball
    Walk upstairs
  else
    return "do not board train, you are going the wrong way"
  END IF
END FUNCTION

function boardTrain(kimball)
  For each CTA.kimball
    return Enter train
  END
END FUNCTION


As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation.
Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm.
It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product).
Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out?

Netflix- predicts what movies/tv viewers will like based on their current selections and preferences. This helps generate their sales and target each users personalized experience
Match.com - uses different algorithms to predict who may be a better match for you, and use that for browsing patterns. This is unique because it increases the potential for success in matches, which increases brand reputation and overall customer satisfaction.
Facebook- uses algorithms to predict likely preference patterns with consumers based on demographic and search information. This helps serve facebook's advertisers and is a unique way for brands to hit their target audiences

Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.

Algorithms are efficient if they are able to use up less resources. This can be measured in speed, memory, etc. Inefficient algorithms use up more resources, whether it be memory, time, money, etc.
